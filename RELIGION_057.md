# 0.5.7 — Oaths of Ash and Salt

Development branch: `feature/0.5.7-ashen-covenant`, based on 0.5.6 staging `fe82a46`.
This is the first source implementation, not an installable release. The existing
0.5.5 installer, payload, overlay hashes and release metadata have not been changed.

## Implemented

`tools/ashen_covenant.py` generates eleven religion files into a supplied staging
directory. The normal full build calls it after Gathering generation and runs its
focused validator. `tools/build.py` supplies the new display name and description.
The stable `cm_hunger_below` religion ID, group and all population references remain.

- Six holy sites, one per island, each with a distinct local effect and lore.
- Eight native religious aspects; two slots, with five clan-specific initial pairs.
- Initial pairs are assigned on the first eligible monthly pulse only when a crown
  has zero aspects. A persistent flag prevents replenishing removed aspects.
- Covenant Favor uses native religious influence: base monthly gain 0.2 and a
  maximum-influence modifier of 100. These are modifiers, not a claim that the
  displayed final gain/cap ignores other game modifiers.
- Three own-country religious actions cost two scaled months of income plus 20
  Favor. Their bonuses last five years; a shared five-year variable blocks stacking.
  An AI action list exposes all three rites to native AI evaluation.
- Twelve eligible random stories, initially delayed one year, then a 5% monthly
  chance while eligible and a three-year cooldown after an event fires.
- The once-only Moot requires the existing Gathering unifier flag and homeland
  control. Local Covenants gives +1 heathen tolerance; First Oathkeeper gives
  +10% stability cost efficiency. Both are permanent until conversion away.
- Religion-specific country bonuses are removed on the next monthly pulse after
  conversion away. Initialization and Moot history remain, preventing repeat grants.

## Holy sites

| Site | District / island | Local effect |
|---|---|---|
| First Mouth | Cinder Crown / Cindermaw | +5% production efficiency |
| Listening Pool | Reedmouth / Brackmaw | +5% monthly food modifier |
| Lantern Steps | Tidefang / Reefhook | +0.001 monthly prosperity |
| Mothers' Basin | Shatterfin / Shatterfin | -0.05 unrest |
| Storm Teeth | Knifeback / Knifeback | +10% defensiveness |
| Emberroot Hollow | Ember Key / Sootwake | +10% defensiveness |

All sites have importance 3 and no country modifier. Shatterfin owns two different
local benefits, not two passive national religious bonuses. Native ownership,
control, religion and holy-site behavior require engine verification.

## Traditions and rites

| Tradition | National effect |
|---|---|
| Feed the Common Hearth | +5% monthly food modifier |
| Smoke Is an Offering | +5% production efficiency |
| Bring the Crew Home | +5% naval morale |
| The Dead Keep Their Names | +10% stability cost efficiency |
| No Axe Without an Oath | +10% defensiveness |
| Every Shore Has Spirits | +1 heathen tolerance |
| The First Share Goes Below | +5% land morale |
| Many Hearths, One Covenant | +5 percentage points clergy target satisfaction |

Cindermaw starts with Smoke / First Share; Brackmaw Hearth / Many Hearths;
Reefhook Crew / Shore Spirits; Shatterfin Crew / Dead; Sootwake Axe / Dead.

Feast of Returning Ash gives +10% stability cost efficiency; Lanterns Upon the
Water gives +10% naval morale; Renewal of the First Oath gives +10 percentage
points clergy target satisfaction. Each lasts five years.

## Deliberate first-pass limits

Tradition changes currently use native add/change/remove actions and their native
prices. A custom council cost/cooldown is not implemented. Adding a parallel
custom button alone would leave a native bypass, so this needs a separate pass.

The twelve stories currently share a simple economic choice: spend 5 gold for
5 Favor and 2 prestige, or take the unpaid option and lose 3 Favor. The paid choice
is hidden below 5 gold; the unpaid option always remains. Text concerning rescue,
burial or repairs describes that transaction: it does not create population,
emancipation, mining, disaster or building effects. Differentiated local outcomes,
scaled event costs and additional event art remain to be developed.

Holy-site restoration states, negotiated pilgrimage access, suppression rules,
custom religion/shrine artwork, and deeper reform opposition are not implemented.
Renewal of the First Oath presently reconciles clergy; it does not repair a
damaged-site state. Existing native graphics and the mod's event paintings are
used as staging art. No new mechanic is gated on a DLC.

## Validation

Run with a Python environment containing the existing build dependencies:

```text
python tools/verify_ashen_covenant.py --game "<EU5>/game"
python tools/verify_exploration.py --game "<EU5>/game"
python tools/verify_economy.py --game "<EU5>/game"
```

The religion check validates unique island placement, existing modifier keys,
starting pairs, encoding/braces, event localization/art references, routing,
initialization guards, Moot dispatch order, scaled prices and shared cooldowns.
It is not an engine parser or simulation. Output under `build/religion-check` is
a partial staging tree and must not be installed as a complete mod.

## Fresh-campaign acceptance before release

1. Check all five countries: religion name, Favor, two aspects after the first
   month, native aspect selection and no extra grants after save/reload.
2. Inspect all six holy sites and their local effects, including both Shatterfin
   islands. Check conquest, occupation and ownership by a foreign religion.
3. Use each rite in separate tests. Verify actual prices, affordability, shared
   cooldown, five-year expiry and persistence after save/reload.
4. Confirm AI can use rites without excessive treasury depletion.
5. Trigger all twelve stories, test below 5 gold and check appropriate eligibility.
6. Complete Gathering; inspect the Moot's two outcomes and verify no repeat on
   reload. Convert away and check cleanup after one month.
7. Recheck 0.5.7 sea-only starting charts and undiscovered foreign land, voyage
   timing, mixed populations and economy. See TESTING.md for screenshot acceptance.
8. Review the fresh game error log; package only after resolving new errors and
   completing the project's clean-download release gate.
