LORE_SECTION = '## The Ashen Covenant\n\nThe Ashborn call their shared faith the Ashen Covenant. Beneath the islands sleeps\nthe Hunger Below, whose fire makes land and whose appetite may consume it. Some\nsay the first goblins were born from that fire; others remember passages that\nclosed behind them. No common account settles the mystery.\n\n"What keeps you living must be fed." Fire, water, roots and the remembered dead\nlend their gifts, and every gift creates an obligation. A chief owes protection\nand provisions to the households that supply his crews. A rescued sailor owes\nlabor to the beacon keepers. A woodcutter owes care to the grove that shelters the\nnext generation. Offerings are useful things: food, rope, charcoal and finished\ncraftwork, with animal sacrifice at some feasts.\n\nThe Returning Mother receives the household cords of Shatterfin. Brackmaw\'s Reed\nListener witnesses agreements beside water. Reefhook tends lamps for the Lantern\nDead, including strangers whose names are lost. Sootwake\'s Rootkeeper shelters\nburial trees and seed groves. At the Storm Teeth, crews honor the Tooth in the\nGale. These powers belong to the shared faith; migrating households carry their\nobservances between islands rather than changing religion at a border.\n\nOathkeepers preserve names, witness agreements, heal and interpret omens. They\nmay be women or men; inheritance, apprenticeship and public recognition vary by\nshrine. Their authority can restrain a chief, but gifts and family loyalties can\nalso purchase a convenient interpretation. The island crowns have no common\nreligious head at the beginning of the campaign.\n\nThe sacred places are young: fissures, pools, cairns, ropes and living groves on\nrecently emerged islands. Carried relics and remembered chants hint at an older\npast without proving where the Ashborn came from. The covenant can welcome an\noutsider adopted into a household, yet its promise of reciprocal duties also\nraises difficult questions about those held in slavery.\n\n'
