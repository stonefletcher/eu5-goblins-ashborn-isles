    'goblins_exploration.6.desc':'Fishermen report that a strange little vessel put ashore along our coast. Its crew were unlike any people they had seen: short, ugly creatures with long pointed ears, sharp teeth and restless eyes. They picked through the shallows and argued in a rasping tongue, but the moment they realized they had been spotted, they scrambled aboard and fled out to sea.\n\nA scout ship followed at a cautious distance, keeping their patched sails just within sight. Beyond our familiar waters, the pursuit led to a cluster of smoke-wreathed islands, their coves crowded with crooked docks and more of the same vessels. Our scouts have returned with a chart of the crossing. Whatever these creatures may be, we now know where they live.',

    'goblins_exploration.1.desc':'Our rough charts trace the nearby waters, but the mainland beyond them remains unknown. After years of gathering provisions and seaworthy hulls, the crews are ready. A small expedition could cross the eastern waters, chart its harbors and learn who lives beyond them.',

Beyond the breakers they found people eager to bargain, and watchmen eager to send them away. A foreign sail followed the expedition home; our islands are no longer a secret.',

    'goblins_exploration.3.title':'The Captains Unroll Their Charts',
    'goblins_exploration.3.desc':'We have charted the first eastern harbors, but the shores farther north and south remain unexplored. Some crews favor the northern waters, others the warmer southern coast. Provisions for another expedition will cost ten gold, and the voyage will take six months.',

Our captains have sounded the cold harbors of Britain and followed the crowded French shore. In foreign taverns they bartered for charts of Spanish coves and the sunlit ports of Morocco. Dock by dock, the distant world takes shape on the council table. Ships can now seek those shores, and their rulers have heard of the Ashborn Isles.',
